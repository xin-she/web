# Dr Xin-She Yang's Webpage

Xin-She Yang is [Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader_(academic_rank)) in Modelling and Simulation as well as Optimization at Middlesex University London, with more than 25 years' experience in teaching and research. He got his DPhil in Applied Mathematics from Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford in 1998. He then worked at Cambridge University Engineering Department and later as a Senior Research Scientist at Mathematics and Scientific Computing Division of UK's National Physical Laboratory. 

He is also an elected Fellow of the *Institute of Mathematics and its Applications* (2021), Fellow of *Asian Computational Intelligence Society* (2023) and Fellow of *Soft Computing Research Society* (2025). He is the co-Editor for Springer's book series: [Springer Tracts in Nature-Inspired Computing](https://www.springer.com/series/16134) and has been on  editorial boards of multiple international journals, such as *Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence* (Elsevier) and *Journal of Computational Science* (Elsevier). He is also a member of the UKRI Talent Peer Review College.

He has given more than 100 keynotes and invited talks in more than 25 countries, including the recent keynotes at international conferences such as EU/ME2015 (Turkey), ICCS2015 (Iceland), SIBGRAPH2015 (Brazil),  IEEE OIPE2016 (Italy), BDIOT2017 (UK), ICIEI2018 (UK), ICAAI2018 (Spain), ICICT2019 (UK), ICCIS2020 (Online), CIS2022 (India), IFOM2023 (Indonesia), and SIMULTECH2024 (France).  He has also served as an external evaluator for many research councils in Austria, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Czech Republic, European Science Foundation, Iceland, Romania, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and UK. He was on the 2023 Expert Panels for UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) research councils on AI doctoral traning centres and Foundations AI. In addition, he has been an external examiner for more than 40 PhD theses from Belgium, India, Italy, Malaysia, Morocco, New Zealand, Serbia, Spain and UK.

He has been a highly ranked scholar (ranked #2 in metaheuristics and #3 in swarm intelligence), according to the [ScholarGPS](https://scholargps.com/scholars/52734943805262/xin-she-yang). 
He is also among the [top 2% scientists](https://www.topresearcherslist.com/Home/Profile/551754) and has won the [Leader Awards in Computer Science](https://research.com/u/xin-she-yang). 
His research interests include algorithms, artificial intelligence, mathematical modelling, engineering simulation, engineering optimization, metaheuristics, nature-inspired computing, 
numerical methods, data mining, and simulation tools.  He was the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) chair for the Task Force on Business Intelligence and Knowledge Management (2015 to 2020). 

He has authored/edited more than 50 books and has published more than 400 peer-reviewed research papers with more than 96,000 citations, and the full lists of his publications are available at [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=fA6aTlAAAAAJ) and at [Web of Science](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/I-5662-2019). He has been on the prestigious list of most influential researchers or [highly-cited researchers](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/I-5662-2019)  (i.e., top 0.1% Scientists, Web of Science) for ten consecutive years since 2016.
