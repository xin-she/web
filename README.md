Xin-She Yang is [Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader_(academic_rank)) in Modelling and Simulation as well as Optimization at Middlesex University London, with more than 25 years' experience in teaching and research. He was a Senior Research Scientist at Mathematics and Scientific Computing Division of UK's National Physical Laboratory. He got his DPhil in Applied Mathematics from Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford in 1998. He is also an elected Fellow of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (2021), Fellow of Asian Computational Intelligence Society (2023) and Fellow of Soft Computing Research Society (2025).

He is the co-Editor for Springer's book series: [Spring Tracts in Nature-Inspired Computing](https://www.springer.com/series/16134) and has been on editorial boards of multiple international journals, such as Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (Elsevier) and Journal of Computational Science (Elsevier). He is also a member of the UKRI Talent Peer Review College.

He has been a highly ranked scholar (ranked #2 in metaheuristics and #3 in swarm intelligence), according to the [ScholarGPS](https://scholargps.com/scholars/52734943805262/xin-she-yang). He is also among the [top 2% scientists](https://www.topresearcherslist.com/Home/Profile/551754) and has won the [Leader Awards in Computer Science](https://research.com/u/xin-she-yang). 

His research interests include algorithms, artificial intelligence, mathematical modelling, engineering simulation, engineering optimization, metaheuristics, nature-inspired computing, numerical methods, data mining, and simulation tools. A full list of his publications are available at Google scholar and at Web of Science.  He was the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) chair for the Task Force on Business Intelligence and Knowledge Management (2015 to 2020). He has published more than 50 books and more than 400 peer-reviewed research papers with more than 96,000 citations, and he has been on the prestigious list of most influential researchers or [highly-cited researchers](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/I-5662-2019) (Web of Science) for ten consecutive years since 2016.
